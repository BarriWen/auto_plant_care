# Auto_Plant_Care

The project creates a smart irrigation system for single/small quantities of landscape/greenery plants or potted plants(golden and ribbon) using Raspberry Pi 5(as core and server for the system), camera(recognize the plant), and Raspberry Pi picos(set up various other sensors and water pump). The system includes a variety of environmental monitoring and automation features. It recognizes and waters the plant automatically. Also, the system shows the data and alerts on a screen which allows users to view and interact with them.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python3 installed.
- A terminal or command-line interface to execute the commands.

### Setup Instructions

To ensure this project runs smoothly, please install all dependencies in the Raspberry Pi's global environment. Using a virtual environment may cause issues with accessing the Pi camera and OpenCV.
