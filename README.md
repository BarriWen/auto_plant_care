["Using picamera2 in virtual environments"](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=361758).

1. **Run the initial preparation script**  
   Run the following command in your terminal to prepare the environment:  
   ```bash
   ./prep.sh

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**  

3. **Install dependencies**  
   Inside the virtual environment, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the secondary preparation script**  
   While still in the virtual environment, run:
   ```bash
   ./prep2.sh
